# Main data links

- [FEC Data Catalog](http://www.fec.gov/data/DataCatalog.do) - the FEC's data offerings are a bit splintered. For now, stick to the Data Catalog and check the left sidebar for things that can be relatively conveniently downloaded.
  - [Candidate Disbursements](http://www.fec.gov/data/CandidateDisbursement.do?format=html) - the itemized payments made by candidate-directed campaigns.
  - [Independent Expenditures](http://www.fec.gov/data/IndependentExpenditure.do?format=html) - What independent expenditures were made on behalf of a candidate.


# Readings about campaign and independent Expenditures

- [FEC's brochure on Coordinated Communications and Independent Expenditures](http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/indexp.shtml)
- [Wikipedia page on Independent Expenditures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_expenditure) -also contains interesting examples of alleged coordination.
